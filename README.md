### 🛒 Retail Sales SQL Analysis


### 📌 Overview
This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using 10 SQL queries (Q1–Q10).
The goal is to understand transaction patterns, customer demographics, product performance, and revenue drivers — and to recommend actions that can improve business performance.

SELECT
`Product Category`,
SUM(`Total Amount`) AS Total_Revenue
FROM `plated-hangout-480700-v9.Retail_data.Retail_sales`
GROUP BY `Product Category`
HAVING SUM(`Total Amount`) > 5000;

Q9	Categorize products by unit cost
SELECT
`Transaction ID`,
`Price per Unit`,
CASE
WHEN `Price per Unit` < 50 THEN 'Cheap'
WHEN `Price per Unit` BETWEEN 50 AND 200 THEN 'Moderate'
ELSE 'Expensive'
END AS Unit_Cost_Category
FROM `plated-hangout-480700-v9.Retail_data.Retail_sales`;

Q10	Analyze spending levels for customers age 40+
SELECT
`Customer ID`,
Age,
`Total Amount`,
CASE
WHEN `Total Amount` > 1000 THEN 'High'
